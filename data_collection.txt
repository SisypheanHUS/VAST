Data collection strategy for Raman spectroscopy
To create your dataset, your data points would be the raw Raman spectra, with the classification labels based on the attributes above. The process would involve these steps:
Select samples: Gather bottles of different types of colorless spirits (vodka, gin, silver rum, etc.) from various brands and with differing alcohol concentrations.
Measure spectra: Use a Raman spectrometer to collect the spectral data for each sample. Many studies have been conducted on spirits, so established methodologies exist.
Non-invasive: Portable Raman systems can measure through the bottle, which saves time and effort.
In-situ: For higher quality data, measure samples directly in a quartz cuvette.
Process spectra: Raw spectral data will need to be processed to remove noise, fluorescence background, and other artifacts.
Create labels: For each processed spectrum, create a data record with the following labels:
Main Alcohol Type: (e.g., Vodka, Gin, etc
